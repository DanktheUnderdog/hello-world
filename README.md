# hello-world
My first GitHub repository

Hello World, 
My name is Brian Weeks and I'm an aspiring developer based in Las Vegas, NV. It has only been five years that I have called Las Vegas home. Prior to living in Las Vegas, I spent 24 years of my life living in the suburbs of North Chicago. My plan is to become a front end web developer working on websites. This is my GitHub story.
